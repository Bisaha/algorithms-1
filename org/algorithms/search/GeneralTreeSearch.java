/**
 * When the collection of data is large, there can still be a large number of
 * comparisons needed to do a binary search. For example, a telephone directory
 * of a large city could easily take about 25 comparisons per search. To improve
 * this, multiway searching uses a general tree, which is a tree data structure
 * that can have more than two children. In multiway searching, we store a few 
 * keys in each tree node, and the children represent the subtrees containing 
 * (a) the entries smaller than all the keys, (b) the entries larger than the 
 * first key but smaller than the rest, (c) the entries larger than the first 
 * two keys but smaller than the rest, and so on. The following figure shows an
 * example of a general tree that can be used for multiway searching. In the
 * root of this tree we have the keys of 6 and 10, so if we are looking for a 
 * key less than 6, we would take the left branch. If we are looking for a key
 * between 6 and 10, we would take the middle branch, and for a key larger than
 * 10, we would take the right branch.
 *
 *                                   (6/10)
 *                           /         |         \
 *                  (2/4)            ( 8 )              (12/14/16)
 *                 /  |  \           /   \            /   /     \   \
 *            ( 1 ) ( 3 ) ( 5 )   ( 7 ) ( 9 )   ( 11 ) ( 13 ) ( 15 ) ( 17 )
