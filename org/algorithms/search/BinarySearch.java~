/**
 * In computer science, a binary search or half-interval search algorithm 
 * locates the position of an item in a sorted array. Binary search works  
 * by comparing an input value to the middle element of the array. The 
 * comparison determines whether the element equals the input, less than the 
 * input or greater. When the element being compared to equals the input the 
 * search stops and typically returns the position of the element. If the 
 * element is not equal to the input then a comparison is made to determine 
 * whether the input is less than or greater than the element. Depending on 
 * which it is the algorithm then starts over but only searching the top or 
 * bottom subset of the array's elements. If the input is not located within the
 * array the algorithm will usually output a unique value indicating this. 
 * Binary search algorithms typically halve the number of items to check with
 * each successive iteration, thus locating the given item (or determining its 
 * absence) in logarithmic time. A binary search is a dichotomic divide and 
 * conquer search algorithm.
