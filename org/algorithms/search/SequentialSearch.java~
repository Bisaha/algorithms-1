/**
 * In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for 
 * finding a particular value in a list, that consists of checking every one of 
 * its elements, one at a time and in sequence, until the desired one is found.
 * 
 * Linear search is the simplest search algorithm; it is a special case of 
 * brute-force search. Its worst case cost is proportional to the number of 
 * elements in the list; and so is its expected cost, if all list elements are 
 * equally likely to be searched for. Therefore, if the list has more than a 
 * few elements, other methods (such as binary search or hashing) may be much 
 * more efficient.
