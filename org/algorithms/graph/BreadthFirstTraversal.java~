/**
 * In a breadth-first traversal, we visit the starting node and then on the 
 * first pass visit all of the nodes directly connected to it. In the second 
 * pass, we visit nodes that are two edges “away” from the starting node. With 
 * each new pass, we visit nodes that are one more edge away. Because there 
 * might be cycles in the graph, it is possible for a node to be on two paths 
 * of different lengths from the starting node. Because we will visit that node
 * for the first time along the shortest path from the starting node, we will 
 * not need to consider it again. We will, therefore, either need to keep a list
 * of the nodes we have visited or we will need to use a variable in the node to
 * mark it as visited to prevent multiple visits.
