/**
 * In depth-first traversal, we visit the starting node and then proceed to 
 * follow links through the graph until we reach a dead end. In an undirected 
 * graph, a node is a dead end if all of the nodes adjacent to it have already 
 * been visited. In a directed graph, if a node has no outgoing edges, we also 
 * have a dead end.
 *
 * When we reach a dead end, we back up along our path until we find an 
 * unvisited adjacent node and then continue in that new direction. The process
 * will have completed when we back up to the starting node and all the nodes 
 * adjacent to it have been visited. In illustrating this algorithm and  all 
 * others in this chapter, if presented with a choice of two nodes, we will
 * choose the node with the numerically or alphabetically smaller label. When
 *  this algorithm is implemented, that choice will depend on how the edges of 
 * the graph are stored.
