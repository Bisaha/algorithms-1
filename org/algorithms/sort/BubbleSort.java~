/**
 * The bubble sort algorithm makes a number of passes through the list of 
 * elements. On each pass it compares adjacent element values. If they are out 
 * of order, they are swapped. We start each of the passes at the beginning of 
 * the list and compare the elements in locations 1 and 2, then the elements in
 * locations 2 and 3, then 3 and 4, and so on, swapping those that are out of 
 * order. On the first pass, once the algorithm reaches the largest element, it
 * will be swapped with all of the remaining elements, moving it to the end of 
 * the list after the first pass. The second pass, therefore, no longer needs to
 * look at the last element in the list. The second pass will move the second 
 * largest element down the list until it is in the second to last location. 
 * The process continues with each additional pass moving one more of the larger
 * values down in the list. During all of this, the smaller values are also 
 * moving toward the front of the list. If on any pass there are no swaps, all 
 * of the elements are now in order and the algorithm can stop. It should be 
 * noted that each pass has the potential of moving a number of the elements 
 * closer to their final position, even though only the largest element on that  * pass is guaranteed to wind up in its final location.
