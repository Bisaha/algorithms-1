/**
 * Quicksort chooses an element of the list, called the pivot element, and then
 * rearranges the list so that all of the elements smaller than the pivot are 
 * moved before it and all of the elements larger than the pivot are moved after
 * it. The elements in each of the two parts of the list are not put in order. 
 * If the pivot element winds up in location i, all we know is that the elements
 * in locations 1 through i Ïª 1 are smaller than the pivot element and those in
 * locations i + 1 through N are larger than the pivot. Quicksort is then called
 * recursively for these two parts. If Quicksort is called with a list 
 * containing one element, it does nothing because a one-element list is sorted.
