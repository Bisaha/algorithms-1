/**
 * The basic idea of insertion sort is that if you have a list that is sorted
 *  and need to add a new element, the most efficient process is to put that 
 * new element into the correct position instead of adding it anywhere and then
 * resorting the entire list. Insertion sort accomplishes its task by 
 * considering that the first element of any list is always a sorted list of 
 * size 1. We can create a two-element sorted list by correctly inserting the 
 * second element of the list into the one element list containing the first 
 * element. We can now insert the third element of the list into the two-element
 * sorted list. This process is repeated until all of the elements have been put
 * into the expanding sorted portion of the list.
